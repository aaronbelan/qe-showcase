# k6 Task: Load Test

**Goal:**  
Write a k6 script to load test the `/posts` endpoint on [jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).

**Requirements:**

- Test GET `/posts` with at least 10 virtual users
- Add thresholds for response time and success rate
- Assert on response status and timing
- (Optional) Add some POST traffic

**Guidance:**

- Organize your script for clarity
- Add comments to explain your choices
- You don’t need to simulate high load — focus on structure

**Estimated time:** 2–4 hours

**Resources:**

- [k6 Docs](https://k6.io/docs/)
- [JSONPlaceholder Guide](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/)

**Have fun!**
