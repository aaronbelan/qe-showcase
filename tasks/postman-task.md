# Postman Task: API Flow

**Goal:**  
Create a Postman collection that exercises the `/posts` endpoint on [jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).

**Steps to cover:**

1. GET `/posts` (list all posts)
2. POST `/posts` (create a new post)
3. PUT `/posts/{id}` (update a post)
4. DELETE `/posts/{id}` (delete a post)

**Requirements:**

- Use variables for base URL and IDs
- Add at least one test script per request (e.g., check status, response shape)
- Include an environment file (can be simple)
- Organize your collection logically

**Estimated time:** Less than 1 hour

**Resources:**

- [Postman Docs](https://learning.postman.com/docs/)
