# Cypress Task: E2E Web Flow

**Goal:**  
Write a Cypress test that covers a basic purchase flow on [saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com).

**Steps to cover:**

1. Log in (use any valid credentials)
2. Sort items (e.g., by price)
3. Add at least one item to the cart
4. Go to the cart and proceed to checkout
5. Fill in checkout info (use any data)
6. Complete the purchase
7. Assert that the order was successful

**Guidance:**

- Use realistic assertions (e.g., check for confirmation messages, cart contents)
- Organize your test(s) as you see fit
- Add comments to explain your thinking
- You donâ€™t need to cover every edge case

**Estimated time:** Less than 1 hour

**Resources:**

- [Cypress Docs](https://docs.cypress.io/)

**Have fun!**
